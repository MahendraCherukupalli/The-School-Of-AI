I. Configuration Issues (config/profiles.yaml)
1.	Incorrect MCP Server cwd (Current Working Directory):
•	Bug (S9_original): The cwd (current working directory) paths for MCP servers in the profiles.yaml configuration file were hardcoded to an absolute path specific to a particular development environment. This prevented the agent from launching these essential server subprocesses correctly on any other machine or if the project's directory structure was altered.
•	Fix (S9): The cwd paths were updated to use relative paths (e.g., "." for the current directory or "modules/" for scripts within a subdirectory). This change ensures that the agent can locate and start its MCP server components regardless of the user's specific machine setup or the project's location on the filesystem, making the system portable.
2.	Commented-Out Memory MCP Server:
•	Issue (S9_original): The configuration entry for the memory MCP server, responsible for providing tools to access conversation history, was commented out in profiles.yaml. This effectively disabled the agent's ability to recall past interactions or use its long-term memory features.
•	Fix (S9): The memory MCP server definition was uncommented in the configuration file, restoring the agent's access to memory-related tools and functionalities.
II. MCP Server and Tool Issues (mcp_server_2.py)
1.	Whitespace in OLLAMA Model Name:
•	Bug (S9_original): A constant defining an Ollama model name (QWEN_MODEL) within mcp_server_2.py inadvertently included a trailing whitespace character. Such an error would likely cause failures when attempting to invoke the specified model via the Ollama API, as the API would not recognize the model name with the extraneous space.
•	Fix (S9): The trailing whitespace was removed from the model name constant, ensuring correct identification and usage of the intended Ollama model.
2.	Ineffective/Problematic Image Captioning and Markdown Cleaning in Webpage Conversion:
•	Issue (S9_original): The convert_webpage_url_into_markdown tool in mcp_server_2.py included a complex sub-process for handling images. This involved attempting to download each image from a webpage, generate a caption using an LLM, replace the image with its caption in the markdown, and then delete the local image copy. This approach was identified as a significant performance bottleneck, being slow and resource-intensive due to multiple LLM calls per webpage. It was also prone to errors related to image downloading, captioning failures, and complex path management, potentially contributing to the agent stalling.
•	Fix (S9 - Implied by Simplification and Prioritization): While the exact line-by-line refactor was not detailed, the focus shifted towards ensuring the core functionality of markdown conversion (likely relying more directly on the trafilatura library's capabilities for robust content extraction) was efficient. The complex image captioning was a candidate for simplification or removal if it wasn't critical, to improve tool reliability and speed, thereby preventing agent stalls.
III. Core Agent Logic Issues (agent.py, core/loop.py, modules/perception.py)
1.	input() Hanging / EOFError After Agent Run:
•	Bug (S9_original): A critical issue was observed where the main agent.py script would frequently hang or terminate with an EOFError (End Of File Error) when attempting to read the next user query via the input() function. This typically occurred after the agent had executed a task involving multiple tool calls through its MCP (Multi-Component Process) subprocesses, suggesting that the standard input stream (sys.stdin) was being adversely affected by the lifecycle or I/O redirection of these subprocesses.
•	Fix (S9): The primary method for reading user input in agent.py was re-engineered to run within a separate thread using asyncio.to_thread(). This isolates the blocking input() call from the main asynchronous event loop, making it more resilient to potential state corruptions of stdin caused by subprocess interactions. The main loop in agent.py was also restructured to have a single, well-defined point for user input, which resolved an associated "double prompt" anomaly. Enhanced error trapping around the input call was also implemented.
2.	Incorrect mcp_server_descriptions Type Leading to AttributeError:
•	Bug (S9_original -> S9 during refactor): In the process of refactoring agent.py, the data structure passed as mcp_server_descriptions to the AgentContext was inadvertently changed from the required dictionary format to a list. This subsequently caused an AttributeError within the modules/perception.py script, as it attempted to call dictionary-specific methods (like .items()) on this list.
•	Fix (S9): The logic in agent.py for preparing MCP server configurations was corrected. It now correctly creates both a list of server configurations (for the MultiMCP component) and a dictionary of server configurations keyed by server ID (for the AgentContext and dependent modules like perception), ensuring each component receives the data structure it expects.
3.	Potentially Inefficient Planning Context due to Verbose Tool Outputs:
•	Issue (S9_original based on logs): Analysis of agent logs indicated that the full, often lengthy, outputs from previous tool executions were being included in the context provided to the planning LLM. This verbosity was suspected of confusing the LLM, leading to suboptimal or repetitive plans and causing the agent to exhaust its allowed operational steps (max_steps) prematurely.
•	Fix (S9): Modifications were made to the context formatting logic (within core/context.py or core/loop.py) to truncate or summarize the results of tool calls before including them in the prompt for the planning LLM. This provides the LLM with a more concise and manageable context, aiming to improve the quality and efficiency of generated plans.
4.	Agent Loop Reaching "Max steps reached" Prematurely:
•	Symptom (S9_original): The agent frequently failed to complete tasks, instead hitting its predefined max_steps limit. This occurred even for queries that, while multi-step, should have been resolvable within the step limit.
•	Root Causes & Fix (S9): This issue was addressed by a combination of the fixes described above:
•	Improving planning efficiency by providing more concise context to the planning LLM (III.3).
•	Increasing the robustness and potentially simplifying the execution of individual tools to prevent them from stalling or taking excessive time (II.2).
•	Refining the main agent loop in agent.py for clearer state management and handling of intermediate results (FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED), ensuring smoother transitions between agent steps.
IV. General Robustness and Code Structure
1.	agent.py Main Loop Complexity and "Double Prompt" Issue:
•	Issue (S9_original): The main control loop in agent.py contained nested while True structures and multiple calls to input(), which made the program flow difficult to trace and debug. This complexity also contributed to an observed anomaly where the agent would sometimes prompt the user for input twice consecutively.
•	Fix (S9): The main() function in agent.py underwent a significant restructuring. The loop logic was simplified to feature a single, unambiguous point for obtaining user input. Session state management was clarified, and the handling of different agent outcomes (e.g., FINAL_ANSWER, FURTHER_PROCESSING_REQUIRED) was made more explicit and robust. Additionally, a finally block was added to ensure that connections to MCP servers are properly shut down when the agent exits.
